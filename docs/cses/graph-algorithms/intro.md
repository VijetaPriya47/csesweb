# Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are fundamental to competitive programming and computer science. They help solve problems involving relationships between objects, networks, and complex data structures.

## üéØ What are Graphs?

A graph is a data structure consisting of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Points in the graph
- **Edges**: Connections between vertices
- **Directed/Undirected**: Edges may have direction or be bidirectional
- **Weighted/Unweighted**: Edges may have associated weights

## üìö Graph Representations

### 1. Adjacency Matrix
```cpp
int graph[n][n];
// graph[i][j] = weight of edge from i to j (0 if no edge)
```

### 2. Adjacency List
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
// graph[i] = list of neighbors of vertex i
```

### 3. Edge List
```cpp
vector<pair<int, int>> edges;
// List of all edges (u, v)
```

## üöÄ Essential Graph Algorithms

### 1. Graph Traversal

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
```cpp
vector<bool> visited(n, false);

void dfs(int v) {
    visited[v] = true;
    for(int u : graph[v]) {
        if(!visited[u]) {
            dfs(u);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
```cpp
vector<bool> visited(n, false);
queue<int> q;

void bfs(int start) {
    q.push(start);
    visited[start] = true;
    
    while(!q.empty()) {
        int v = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for(int u : graph[v]) {
            if(!visited[u]) {
                visited[u] = true;
                q.push(u);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Shortest Path Algorithms

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
```cpp
// For weighted graphs with non-negative weights
priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
vector<int> dist(n, INF);
```

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
```cpp
// For graphs with negative weights (no negative cycles)
vector<int> dist(n, INF);
dist[source] = 0;
```

### 3. Minimum Spanning Tree

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
```cpp
// Sort edges by weight, use Union-Find
sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());
```

#### Prim's Algorithm
```cpp
// Start with one vertex, add minimum weight edges
priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
```

### 4. Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
```cpp
// Kosaraju's Algorithm or Tarjan's Algorithm
vector<vector<int>> scc;
```

## üí° Tips for Graph Problems

1. **Choose the Right Representation**: Adjacency list for sparse graphs, matrix for dense graphs
2. **Consider Edge Cases**: Disconnected components, cycles, self-loops
3. **Optimize Traversal**: Use appropriate data structures (queue for BFS, stack for DFS)
4. **Handle Multiple Components**: Check for connectivity
5. **Memory Management**: Be careful with large graphs
